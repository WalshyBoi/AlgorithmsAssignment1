# AlgorithmsAssignment1 - David Walsh 20068382  

This is the application I made for the object detection assignment, the program is run via the GUI I 
have made. It has the option to choose between four different images in the gui but can be changed in 
the ConnectedComponentImage class to take in any image, though the stars image may take some time as 
it is so large. The class reads in an image, applies binarisation to the image, colors the components 
in the image, highlights the components with a red boundry box. It can also return the count accuratly 
for the amount of objects in the image and also one for the background. I have also provided around 60% 
or so test coverage though the tests for the colored component is not working though I feel it should.
